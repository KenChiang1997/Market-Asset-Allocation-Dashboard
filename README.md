# Abstract
Harry Markowitz introduced modern portfolio theory in 1950 and won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1990, but there are still many problems with this model. In this project, I built a dashboard for 5 differents markets and applied mean-variance optimization to analyze whether it can successfully outperformance the SP500 Benchmark Index.

The project is still updating.....
